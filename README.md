# Cats
Single Page JavaScript Application to display GIF results from Giphy's developer API https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI.
The requirements were:
- A control to show latest Cats or Dog results (tabs).
- A lightbox which shows the selected GIF when clicked/hovered/interacted with.
- Results view with paging of 25 GIFs per page.

The stack I used for this one is `React`, `Typescript`, `React hooks`, `Redux toolkit`, `Sagas` and `Jest`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs tests 

### `npm run build`

Builds a production ready artifact
